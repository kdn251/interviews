// We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

// I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

// Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

// You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

// -1 : My number is lower
//  1 : My number is higher
//  0 : Congrats! You got it!
// Example:
// n = 10, I pick 6.

// Return 6.
