// Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of â€™1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

// For example, the 32-bit integer â€™11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.

public class NumberOfOneBits {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        if(n == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
